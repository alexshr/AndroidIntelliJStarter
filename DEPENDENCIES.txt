The following is a list of all software licenses for projects that we depend on.

We "link" against Java and Android, but we don't ship it.

We intend to include the following dependencies in the binary that we ship:

    guava-libraries: Apache License 2.0, http://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/
    guice-2.0-no_aop.jar
    httpmime-4.1.jar
    jackson-core-asl-1.8.4.jar
    jackson-mapper-asl-1.8.4.jar
    roboguice-1.1.2.jar
    # list other production dependencies here

The following are used during testing only, not shipped as part of the binary in the app store:

    submodules/robolectric
    asm-3.3.1.jar
    asm-commons-3.3.1.jar
    great-expectations-0.10.jar
    junit-4.8.2.jar
