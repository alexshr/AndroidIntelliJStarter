The following is a list of all software licenses for projects that we depend on.

We "link" against Java and Android, but we don't ship it.

We intend to include the following dependencies in the binary that we ship:

    Google Roboguice/Guice - Apache 2.0 License
    # list other production dependencies here

The following are used during testing only, not shipped as part of the binary in the app store:

    Android Google APIs (the Android maps extension from Google)
    Pivotal Robolectric (MIT License) and all of its dependencies
    # list other test-only dependencies here
